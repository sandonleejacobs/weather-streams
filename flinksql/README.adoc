= Applying Flink SQL

== Transforming Data
In many cases, the data we receive from another party may not be in a "usable" or "friendly" state when initially presented

such as aggregations and queries.

The Simple Message Transformations (SMTs) in our HTTP Source Connector did the heavy lifting with regards to data transformations
from the JSON responses into Kafka events like the one below:
