= Weather Streams

Using NOAA APi data to showcase features of Confluent Cloud - including Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect,
Confluent Schema Registry, Flink SQL on Confluent Cloud, and Terraform Confluent Provider.

== Sourcing Data

=== NOAA Weather APIs

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides a free API with access to forecasts, alerts and observations.
https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api[Per their documentation]:

[quote]
All of the information presented via the API is intended to be open data, free to use for any purpose. As a public service of the United States Government, we do not charge any fees for the usage of this service, although there are reasonable rate limits in place to prevent abuse and help ensure that everyone has access. The rate limit is not public information, but allows a generous amount for typical use. If the rate limit is execeed a request will return with an error, and may be retried after the limit clears (typically within 5 seconds). Proxies are more likely to reach the limit, whereas requests directly from clients are not likely.

.For purposes of this demo, we plan to use:
* `/zones` - get the latest Zone definitions. These are fairly "static" in nature, so we will infrequently request this data.
* `/alerts/active` - get ACTIVE weather alerts. This will include updates and cancellations of those alerts.

== Confluent Cloud Assets
In this repo we use the Confluent Terraform Provider to provision the Confluent Cloud assets needed to load and process
the data from the NOAA APIs.

.There are some prerequisites for this using demo:
* link:https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli[Install terraform] for your OS.
* Create a link:http://confluent.cloud[Confluent Cloud] Account.
* Confluent CLI (not "required" - but very helpful for the following):
** link:https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/command-reference/confluent_login.html[Confluent Cloud Login]
** link:https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/command-reference/api-key/confluent_api-key_create.html[Create Cloud API Key]

=== Disclaimer
Throughout this repo, you see this added to each terraform resource:
```
lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = false
}
```
Per terraform docs, this is not suggested for code in a production or production-like environment. It is added here so
the Confluent Cloud assets can be destroyed using `terraform destroy` once you're done with this demo (saving you time and money!!!).

=== Try For Yourself

** If you're attending Kafka Summit London, stop by the DevX Pod at the Confluent booth to get promo code for Confluent Cloud.
This should be sufficient for you to try this demo on your own and experiment with the data, connectors, and terraform.

From there, clone this repo and take note of the terraform commands listed in the doc files. If anything is missing, ambiguous, or just
flat our WRONG, feel free to create an Issue in GitHub and/or submit a PR.

* Clone repo and change to the `terraform` directory of the repo.
* Use `confluent organization list` to get the value of organization ID. Needed to set as a terraform variable.
```
> confluent organization list
  Current |                  ID                  |   Name    | JIT Enabled
----------+--------------------------------------+-----------+--------------
  *       | <UUID VALUE FOR ORGANIZATION ID>     | My Org    | false
```
* Use `confleunt login` to authenticate to Confluent Cloud. (see previous section)
```
> confluent login --prompt --save
Email Address: <your email used in CC account>
Password: *********
```
* Use `confluent api-key create` command to create Cloud API Keys and set the following environment variables in the current shell:
```
# Linux/Unix/MacOS users...
export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_KEY=<KEY>
export CONFLUENT_CLOUD_API_SECRET=<SECRET>
```
* Initialize the terraform state:
```
> terraform init
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of confluentinc/confluent from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed confluentinc/confluent v1.66.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

* Validate the syntax of the terraform code:
```
terraform validate
│ Warning: Deprecated Resource
│
│   with data.confluent_schema_registry_region.essentials,
│   on kafka-cluster.tf line 3, in data "confluent_schema_registry_region" "essentials":
│    3: data "confluent_schema_registry_region" "essentials" {
│
│ The "schema_registry_region" data source has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of the provider (2.0.0). Refer to the Upgrade Guide at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/confluentinc/confluent/latest/docs/guides/version-2-upgrade for more details. The guide will be published once version 2.0.0 is released.
│
│ (and one more similar warning elsewhere)
╵
Success! The configuration is valid, but there were some validation warnings as shown above.
```
IMPORTANT: We're aware of this deprecation warning. When alternative solutions go GA, this will be fixed.

* Create a terraform plan named `tfplan`, using your organization ID as a variable value:
```
terraform plan -out "tfplan" -var org_id=24dcc3ed-963b-44c7-90ce-e5e021631d44
```

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

In approximately 6 minutes, we have a Kafka Cluster, Schema Registry, Kafka Topics, registered Avro schemas, HTTP Connectors,
and a Flink Compute Pool. If configuration changes are needed for these assets, make the changes to the corresponding
terraform resource, then run the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` steps again.
